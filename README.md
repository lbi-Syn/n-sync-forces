#LBi(D) Hack Day: N Sync Forces

#Setup

Clone this repository and then run the steps below to get a simple Python server running the project. Python is installed as standard on macs so it's really as simple as below. 

Steps:
	
	1. Open up terminal
		
	2. Change directory to this project folder
		(e.g. > cd /path/to/project )
			
	3. Run the following command:
		> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
			
	4. Open a browser and view http://localhost:8080
	
N.B. You can change the 8080 to any port number you want, for example python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000 would serve up http://localhost:9000 and so on.
